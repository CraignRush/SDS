# Systemtheorie der Sinnesorgane
Homework assignments for the lecture "System Theory of the Senses" (Systemtheorie der Sinnesorgane) at Technical University Munich.
Still some mistakes in it.

Figure 3:
a sine wave should have only 1 peak in spectrum. in your plot there are some side lobes as well. Probably you did not cut the zeros befor and after the sine wave (It was mentioned in the exercise to do that!).
The peak amplitude is also not correct. It should be 100 nm and not around 60 nm.
Same for figure 4. Amplitude at f = 200 should be about 10 mV.
Q3. you should have used max of g_a (11.6 nS) and not the min of it (8.14 nS). Formulations are correct though. f_min = 2933 Hz
