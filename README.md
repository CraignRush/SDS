# Systemtheorie der Sinnesorgane
Homework assignments for the lecture "System Theory of the Senses" (Systemtheorie der Sinnesorgane) at Technical University Munich.
Still some mistakes in it.

Feedback:
Normally we show time signals in lower case and their fft in upper case.
Better to use u(t) instead of U(t) in Figure 1.
For LRMS, first you need to calculate the RMS of the time signal and the calculate the dB. You did the other way around.
LRMS = 20*log10(RMS/u0) = 20*log10(0.8660) = -1.2496 dB V.
The LRMS plot for spectrum is also missing.
